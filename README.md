![bitcar in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carsdotcom/bitcar/master/bitcar-google-demo.gif)

## Requirements

   *  node 6.x.x or newer
   *  either bash 3+, or zsh 5+

Older versions of zsh may work, but are untested.

## Installation

```
npm i -g bitcar
```

## Setup

```
bitcar --setup
```

Setup will drop a few dotfiles in `~/.bitcar` and it will append a few lines to your `~/.bash_profile`.

Note: You MUST use the command name you chose during setup. Only use the `bitcar` command itself for setup.

**IMPORTANT: Now, start a new terminal session.**

## Usage

In the examples below, it is assumed you have set your bitcar command to `bit`. If you've chosen a different command name, adjust accordingly.

### Search / Clone / Change Directory to Repo

```
bit {searchTerm}
```

### Open Repo in Browser

```
bit --open {searchTerm}
```

```
bit -o {searchTerm}
```

### Open Repo in Editor

```
bit --edit {searchTerm}
```

```
bit -e {searchTerm}
```

### Refresh Cache

```
bit --refresh
```

```
bit -r
```

This is done automatically the first time you try and use bitcar, but you can also manual refresh the cache when needed.

### Defaults

The `bit` command without any `searchTerm` will drop you into the root bitcar workspace.

For `--open` and `--edit`, the `searchTerm` argument is optional. If no `searchTerm` is given, then bitcar will attempt to open the current directory's repo.

## Github personal access token settings

If you'd like to use bitcar with your private repos, you'll need to setup a
[personal access token on your github
account](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new). Please ensure you've set the
correct scope for this token. The `repo` scope should be fully enabled.

## Experimental Features

*WARNING: Experimental features are named so for a reason! These are currently under active development and may or may not be part of future releases. Use at your own risk.*

### Clone All

```
bit --clone-all {searchTerm}
```

This will clone ALL repos which match the `searchTerm`. If `searchTerm` is omitted it will clone ALL repos in your local cache. You will be prompted to confirm your intention.

### Sync Existing

```
bit --sync-existing
```

This will add any existing repos in your bitcar workspace to your cache if they are not already there. Run this after each `--refresh`. This is particularly useful if you are using bitcar to manage your GOPATH.

### Create Repo

```
bit --create {repoName}
```

```
bit -c {repoName}
```

Currently this only works for GitHub. Please note you must include the domain in the repo name. i.e. `bit -c github.com/machellerogden/foo`.

This feature will remain experimental until more options are added. For the time being, it will create a public repo on your github account. After creating the repo you will need to run a cache refresh in order for bitcar to find the new repo.
